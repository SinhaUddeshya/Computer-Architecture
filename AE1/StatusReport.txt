Both Versions of the exercise are completed, compiled and successfully executed.
Both parts work correctly. We have used a test data set to confirm the desired functioning of both the versions.
Problems faced:
1) Haskell gives a lot of indentation errors even if the comments are not indented which could be frustating sometimes.
2) Haskell auto-correct is not always helpful.
3) Haskell online documentation and relevant materials are very abstruse which makes it difficult to analyze the next steps
if we get stuck.

Further comments could be found in the code.
